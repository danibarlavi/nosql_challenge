# nosql_challenge

The following class assignments were highly helpful for me in terms of working off them for code:
-- Stu_ImportDataExplore
-- Stu_PyMongo_with_Imported_JSON_Data
-- Stu_AggregationPipeline

I also had some help from ChatOpenAI for the following:
-- Updating MongoDB entries
-- Findingd the # of documents in a collection or query
-- Data transformation (string to float/integer) in PyMongo
-- Code to confirm said data transformation
-- Language for querying Mongo databases
-- Coverting query results to Pandas 
-- And of course, trouble shooting!
